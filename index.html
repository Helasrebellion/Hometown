         <section>

            <h3>Florence, Y'all</h3>
            <p>Florence is well known in surrounding cities for a water tower
               visible
               from I-71/I-75 that reads "Florence Y'all". Built in 1974, the
               tower
               originally advertised the up-and-coming Florence Mall, as part of
               an
               agreement with the mall developers who donated the land for the
               tower.
               But because the mall was not built yet, the tower violated
               highway
               regulations, and the city was forced to change it within a short
               deadline. Rather than repaint the entire tower, they simply
               painted
               over the two vertical lines of the "M" to create a "Y". The
               intent
               was
               to change it back when the mall was built, but the local
               residents
               liked the tower's new proclamation, so the city decided to leave
               it
               as
               it was.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The Florence area was originally known as Crossroads, because of
               the
               convergence of several roads from Burlington and Union at Ridge
               Road
               (now U.S. 25). By 1821, the area was known as Maddentown for
               Thomas
               Madden, a Covington attorney who owned a farm on the Burlington
               Pike.
               When Madden moved away, the area became known as Connersville in
               1828
               for Jacob Conner, a settler who assumed responsibility for the
               growing
               town. The town was finally renamed Florence because there was
               another
               Connersville in Harrison County.</p>
